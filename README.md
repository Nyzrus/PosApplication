# PosApplication

POS(Point of Sale) Applications are used in every modern restaurant for digitally communicating orders between the front and the back of the house(servers and kitchen).

I've worked in restaurants for a long time, and I thought it would be a fun project to use some Hibernate and J2EE tools.

In this project, I really tried to stress a separation of layers as advised by Martin Fowler in his seminal work, Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture.
As one can see in the project structure I attempted to keep the various logic layers as separate as possible delineating View(effectively the JSP and CSS files), DTO, Service, and Database layers.
