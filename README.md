#POS Application#

POS(Point of Sale) Applications are used in every modern restaurant for digitally communicating orders between the front and the back of the house(servers and kitchen).

I've worked in restaurants for a long time, and I thought it would be a fun project to use some Hibernate and J2EE tools. I kept the UI pretty simple for simplicity's sake.

In this project, I really tried to stress a separation of layers as advised by Martin Fowler in his seminal work, Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture. As one can see in the project structure I attempted to keep the various logic layers as separate as possible delineating View(effectively the JSP and CSS files), DTO, Service, and Database layers.
